### Where we are

London, England, Captial of an old Empire that sailed forth to conquere the world in search of tea and spices only to return to a diet of <a href="http://www.foodsofengland.co.uk/peawet.htm">pea wet</a> and beer. Or does it? As a consequence of its history, London today is one of the most multicultural cities in Europe and consequenty also one of the most multiculinary ones. This allows us to analyse data about eating habits of modern Londoners to learn what on our plates divide us and what defines us.

In the following we want to analyse a data set of the Tesco Purchases of Tesco Loyality Card holders in districts of the Greater London Area, and combine this with information about the areas inhabitants collected by the Greater London census.

### The who is who of London

As an important first step to explore the population of London, we need to subdivide the population of London in . To achieve this, we conducted Agglomorative Hierachical Clustering, to identify most similar subgrouping of the population based on attributes, such as Education, Median Household Income and Ethnicity. However, this only allows us to find groupings, not direct labels for each grouping. Thus we needed to conduct our own. As the weather in London is rather Covid-ty around this time of the year and thus can't validate our findings in Person, we conduced our study of the inhabitans in the subgroubed areas, based both on information present in the data and verified our conclusion, with wider research on the areas.

### Why it is important

Why is food important, sounds like an easy question to answer, however besides the importance of having sufficent food, the modern day issue in developed countries is having a proper composition and balance of nutirents. An improper diet might not lead to inbalanced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humorism">humors</a>, as ancient doctors believed, but has far more intertwined effect on the individuals health. 

This becomes also important as an issue of public health, as the UK as most other European Countries uses a socalised healthcare system, in which individual well-being and preventable health-outcomes become a <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g5143">societal concern</a>.
